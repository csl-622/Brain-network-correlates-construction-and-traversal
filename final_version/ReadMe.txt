===============================================================================
This is the Read Me of the Project.

The input needed for this code to run is the parsed Wiki data, as well as the test books.

The 'main.py' program that creates the concept graph. Then the shorten_list.py makes the merged list even shorter for processing. The make_conceptgraph.py can be used to generate the networkx graph file of the concept graph.

For testing purposes, the file processBook.py processes the testing books. And the make_subgraph.py can be executed to get the nodelist.

The shortest_path.py and shortest_path_analysis.py can be used to determine and analyse the shortest paths.

And check_random.py can be used to perform the random test.
